# Alfred 2 workflow Delete Recent File

Recent file list is a convenience function that let you open files quickly.
It's a nice feature, I agree. But if it makes you unsatisfied when there're unexpected items added to the list,
this tool may help you.

## Installation

You can download the [Delete Recent File.alfredworkflow](https://github.com/tyeen/delete_recent_file/raw/master/Delete%20Recent%20Files.alfredworkflow) and import it to Alfred 2.

Or you can `git clone` or download this repository.

## Usage
### 1.Trigger this workflow by typing the keyword `delrecent`.
> Feel free to change the keyword to whatever you like after importing this workflow:)

A list of apps which are keeping their own recent files is shown.

### 2. Type the application name .
After typing the trigger keyword, you can either input the *app name* whose recent file list you want to clear, or press `SPACE` key if the first item displayed in the candidate list matches your target.

### 3. Select the item that you want to clear.
The last step is simple. You just select an item which you want to delete. Or if you prefer typing,
you can continue hitting keyboard just like step 2.

After the deletion, a notification will pop up to let you know things are done.
